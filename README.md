# Retro-JoypadTester
**A DirectInput Joypad/Joystick Tester for Windows - shows all the input values of your controllers**

It's only about 30 lines of code, but I needed something so I could track what EmulationStation and RetroArch were seeing and why my buttons were swapped in MAME. Others may find it useful, or want to expand on it, so please feel free to fork and pull etc.
